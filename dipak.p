Algorithm Analysis (1/2)
● Checking after writing the program?
○
○
If algorithms are to be compared?
Can we test any program for all the possible values?
● Analyze such that
○
○
○
All the possible inputs are taken into account
Allows us to evaluate efficiency independent of hardware and software environments
Can be performed without implementing
  *  Asymptotic Analysis & Notations  *
● Asymptotic Analysis of algorithms is analysis of the run
time based on the size of the input and the growth of the
runtime.
● Asymptotic notations are the notations used in Asymptotic
analysis
