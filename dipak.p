Algorithm Analysis (1/2)
● Checking after writing the program?

○
If algorithms are to be compared?
Can we test any program for all the possible values?
● Analyze such that

○
All the possible inputs are taken into account
Allows us to evaluate efficiency independent of hardware and software environments
Can be performed without implementing
